 * pipeline.js: the automation orchestrator, the heart of the app.

 * One job = one prompt. Its path through the pipeline:

 *          -> on approval: publish / upload
 * Generation and inspection run as two lanes in parallel: while the GPU renders
 * the next job, the previous batch is being checked, so neither waits for the
 * other. AutoMode (bottom of the file) runs rounds unattended: it picks a theme,
 * writes prompts, respects hourly limits and stop conditions, and rebuilds the
 * learned playbook as results come in.
 *
 * Quality check is designed not to be a rubber stamp: the vision model must list
 * defects before it may score, and three independent checks in code (a general
 * rating, a veto on structural defects such as extra fingers, and a detail metric
 * measured on the pixels) can only LOWER the score, never raise it.

HOW THIS GENERATOR WORKS
The art style you pick is a prompt template: your description is inserted into it, and it
brings its own rendering language and negative prompt with it. Every other control appends
its own sentence to the prompt. So the controls are not tags on top of your prompt — they
are part of it, and a control you set is wording you do not have to write.

${menu}
${houseBlock}${modeBlock}
Write ${count} DISTINCT images. For each one:
- "prompt": ONE scene, 40-90 words. Character(s), body, outfit, pose,
  expression, setting, lighting, camera angle. Clear and specific about the theme.
  Generator input, not a caption: comma-separated fragments, subject first. Never open by
  naming the medium — no "anime illustration", no "digital art of", no "an image of".
- "controls": the generator settings for that scene. Rules:
  · ${pinnedStyle
    ? `Do NOT set "artStyle". It is fixed at "${pinnedStyle}" for every image in this batch and`
      + ` your choice would be discarded. Write for that style.`
    : 'Always set "artStyle" — it is the single biggest decision, and the default is a photo style.'}
  · Set at most ${maxControls} controls in total. Fewer, chosen well, beats filling in the form.
  · Only set a control the scene actually calls for. An unset control adds nothing; a wrongly
    set one puts wording in the prompt that fights what you wrote.
  · Do not restate a control in the prose. If you set the location control, do not also spend
    twenty words describing the room.
  · Use the option text from the menu where one fits. Where none does, name what you want in
    plain words — the closest real option will be matched for you.
- Vary composition across the ${count} images: different poses, angles, settings, moods${pinnedStyle
    ? '. The art style is fixed, so the variety has to come from the scene.'
    : ` — and\n  different art styles unless the theme demands one.`}

  prompt puts fighting wording into the same sentence; a control you leave alone adds nothing.

  the prompt leaves to the generator.

${asked}
Work in this exact order.

STEP 1 - REGION CHECK. Go region by region and record a verdict for each one, clean or not.
- Hands: count the fingers on each visible hand and state the counts. Fused, missing, extra, or wrongly bent fingers are defects.
Report only digits you can actually distinguish. A visible subset behind an object is not evidence of missing anatomy. Mark hidden regions NOT_VISIBLE; mark visible but too small/unclear to judge UNKNOWN and explain the visibility limit. Never fill an uncertain count with 5 or call an unexamined region CLEAN.
- Limbs: count arms and legs. Check every joint bends the correct way and connects to the body.
- Face: eye symmetry, pupil alignment and gaze direction, teeth, ear placement and count.
- Anatomy: proportions, torso twist, shoulders, anywhere two body parts merge into each other.
- Rendering: smearing, melted or mushy texture, loss of sharpness and fine detail, warped straight lines in the background, stray text, watermark or signature artifacts, duplicated objects.
- Composition: unintended cropping of head, face, or limbs at the frame edge.
A clean region is a RESULT, not a failure to inspect. "hands: CLEAN (left 5, right 5)" is exactly as valid an answer as a defect, and it is never a shortcut. Leave out only a region you genuinely did not examine.

STEP 2 - NAME THE DEFECTS. ONE problem in ONE place is ONE defect. Never split a single bad hand into four defects because it shows four symptoms (fused fingers, wrong thumb, no knuckles): that one hand is one defect. Two bad hands are two defects. Count places, not symptoms. List only what a viewer could actually see, and never invent a defect to fill the list.

STEP 3 - RATE each defect by HOW VISIBLE IT IS TO A VIEWER WHO WAS NOT TOLD TO LOOK. Also give \`area\` (roughly how much of the picture it affects: "a corner", "one hand", "the whole lower half") and \`focus\` ("yes" if it sits on the part of the picture a viewer looks at first).
- minor = INVISIBLE. You found it because you inspected; a viewer at normal size would not see it. A slightly short finger, a small asymmetry, an artifact in a corner.
- noticeable = VISIBLE. A viewer sees it without being told, and the picture still works.
- severe = BREAKS. The eye goes there first and the picture is spoiled: a missing limb, two bodies merged into one, a melted face, hands as shapeless blobs, an element that contradicts the prompt so hard the scene no longer reads.
The SAME flaw is not the same severity in two different pictures. A slightly mangled hand that is small, occluded or in the background is minor; a hand the composition centres on is noticeable. Sitting on the focus point raises a defect by at most one step — it does not by itself make it severe.

STEP 4 - SCORE the picture as a whole, not the length of the list. Score the WORST thing you found, not the average of what you inspected: the question is whether this frame could go out as it is. One bad hand is one visible flaw and lands at 6, never at 3, and a picture with several defects is not automatically the sum of them.
10 = you inspected everything and found nothing a viewer would notice, and the detail holds up at normal viewing size
9 = one minor defect, invisible unless pointed at
8 = two or more minor defects, still invisible unless pointed at
7 = no defect in your list at all — every region came back clean
6 = one visible defect, everything else clean — a good picture with something wrong in it
5 = two visible defects, or one visible defect sitting on the focus point
4 = one severe defect — the picture is spoiled
3 = one severe defect plus other visible ones
2 = more than one severe defect
1 = the render failed and the picture is unusable

Calibration: an empty defect list claims a flawless render — only leave it empty if you actually counted fingers and limbs, and then it is a 9 or a 10. Padding the list is equally wrong. But a visible defect in the list always caps the picture at 6, because the question is whether it could go out as it is: a hand, limb or face a viewer would notice is not offset by the rest of the frame being good.

STEP 5 - FIX. In one short sentence: the single change that would raise this picture by one point. If it is already a 10, write "nothing".

STEP 6 - DESCRIBE. Only now, with the score already decided, stop inspecting and look at the picture the way a viewer would. In ONE sentence, say what it actually shows: who is in frame, how much of them, what they are doing, what they are wearing, and where they are. Concrete and plain. Say nothing about render quality and name no defect — that work is finished and this sentence is not part of it. Someone who will never see this image has to write its title from your sentence alone, so lead with whatever a viewer notices first.

Answer each gate independently. Answer YES only when you have actually verified it in the picture, and say YES rather than NO about anything genuinely out of frame or hidden.

If a visible region is too small or unclear to assess, answer UNKNOWN and explain the limitation in worst; do not guess YES or invent a NO. An UNKNOWN leaves QC incomplete and retryable, not a verdict about the artwork. Hidden digits are not missing anatomy.
- hands: every hand in frame shows five separate fingers with a palm and knuckles. Fingers fused or run together, a hand with no division at all, an extra or missing digit, or fingers growing out of the wrong place are each NO.
- limbs: every arm and leg is present, attached where it belongs, and bending the way a joint bends. A limb that is missing, duplicated, bent backwards, or that ends in nothing is NO.
- no_merges: no part of the body runs into another part, into clothing, or into whatever the character is touching; nothing has melted into an unresolved mass of colour.
- face: eyes, pupils, ears, nose, mouth and teeth are where they belong and correctly formed. Misaligned, crossed, duplicated or missing features, or a mouth and jaw that do not resolve, are NO.
- detail: at normal viewing size the picture is clean. Smearing, mush, blotches, swirls standing in for texture, or any area gone to a flat smear instead of detail is NO — the background, and anything with a straight line in it, shows this first.

Then, and only then, rate it as one number: "overall", 1-10, the competence of the finished piece to a paying viewer comparing it with other art. 10 = you cannot find anything wrong with it; 8 = good and clean; 6 = clearly flawed but it still works as a picture; 4 = the flaw is the first thing you see; 2 = unusable. If hands, limbs, no_merges or face came back NO, the overall cannot be above 6. A detail NO alone is a soft or busy render rather than a broken picture, and a picture that is only soft can still be a 7 or an 8 — say so with the number rather than punishing it twice.
